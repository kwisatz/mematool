--- Automatic mail ... do not reply to this mail directly ! ---


This is a reminder for paying your syn2cat membership fee.
If you are sure you have already paid, please ignore this mail...
bank<->mematool synchronization is a manual task.
BTW, you can see the status of your received payments in mematool[0] or contact me[1]
if you wish.

Please consider setting up a standing order or paying at least on a 6month 
basis.
If possible also think about managing your payments autonomously so we don\'t 
have to bug you each time 

For those being late already a couple of months, I urge you to get in contact 
with me else we will have to consider your silence as a wish to leave the 
association.

As always....payment troubles are ok and we are understanding....just let us 
know.


Payment information:
- 1 year fee = 114euro
- Bank account:
    Holder:    syn2cat a.s.b.l.
    Bank:      BCEE
    IBAN:      LU93 0019 3255 6612 9000
    BIC/SWIFT: BCEELULL



cheerz.... see you and thanks for your continuing support
